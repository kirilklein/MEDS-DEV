  This file specifies the base configuration for the prediction of breast cancer in women above 50. 
  The trigger is observation due to suspected cancer (DZ031 in the Danish system).
  Since there is a delay in the coding and other cancer related codes can leak, 
  we use input data from more than one month before the trigger.
  
  The target is breast cancer diagnosis.
